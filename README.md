# Advent-of-Code-2022
Code repository storing my solutions for Advent of Code 2022

Note: if you want to run any of my obfuscated C solutions, you might want to add the `-trigraphs` option when compiling to ensure that digraph and trigraph support is enabled, because some compilers might not support these out the box!
